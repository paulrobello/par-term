I want to use the ralph loop tool for $ARGUMENTS

Create a task list file starting with cc-ralph-loop-TASK_NAME.md for it in the root of this repo.
The workflow should be:
- use the /fix-issue for each item
- update the changelog
- commit and push 
- merge pr to main

When all items are done the loop is complete
